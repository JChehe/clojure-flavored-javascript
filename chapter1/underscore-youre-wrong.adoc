=== Underscore You're Wrong

You'll probably come up with underscore.js in mind when mentioning functional programmint in JavaScript, here's the description of underscore.js:
__Underscore provides over 100 functions that support both your favorite workaday functional helpers: map, filter, invoke — as well as more specialized goodies: function binding, javascript templating……__

wait, I'm not agree on the term "fucntional helpers" that much。

==== "map" is different

let's see how other functional language doing map:

Clojure::
----
(map inc [1,2,3])
----
Haskell::
----
map (1+) [1,2,3]
----

`inc` is a function simply increase the number. now lets see how underscore doing map:
----
_.map([1,2,3], function(x){return x+1})
----

any difference? yeah, the order of arguments.

OK, you'll gonna say just difference in order, not a big deal.

but let's compare with other JavaScript functional library:

http://ramdajs.com/[ramdajs]::
----
R.map(function(x){return x+1}, [1,2,3])
----
http://functionaljs.com/[functionaljs]::
----
fjs.map(function(x){return x+1}, [1,2,3])
----

now is it a little bit awkward?

==== ClojureScript
Underscore is different, so there should be a reason how all others doing. I'm not gonna use it as functional library in this book, instead, clojure seems so simple and pure functional. it's lisp so it simple, and it running on JVM which make it powerful. But the more important thing is, ClojureScript can compile to JavaScript, so it can be running on browser and anywhere JavaScript can.

But I'm not talking about ClojureScript here, i'm looking for a functional library.

==== Mori

mori is basically a compiled ClojureScript data structure and functions, it's perfect choice that I can use it as a functional library for JavaScript, and gain all the good part of immutable data structure from Clojure。
